# Simulation and analysis scripts for the paper 'Comparison of random-effects meta-analysis models for the relative risk in the case of rare events - A simulation study'

This repository provides the scripts used for the simulations descriped in the paper 'Comparison of random-effects meta-analysis models for the relative risk in the case of rare events - A simulation study'. The simulation script itself and the initial data preparation were run on a computing cluster and take a while to run. The remaining scripts which prepare the data specifically for plotting, plot the results and create tables with the results can easily be run on a PC. As the simulations take a little bit longer to run, I also provided the respective results as rds files. The session info for the simulation I ran is given in the rds file session_info.rds.
