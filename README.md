# Simulation and analysis scripts for the paper 'Comparison of random-effects meta-analysis models for the relative risk in the case of rare events - A simulation study'

This repository provides the scripts used for the simulations descriped in the paper 'Comparison of random-effects meta-analysis models for the relative risk in the case of rare events - A simulation study'. The simulation script itself and the initial data preparation were run on a computing cluster and take a while to run. The remaining scripts which prepare the data specifically for plotting, plot the results and create tables with the results can easily be run on a PC. The files with the simulation results, the random seeds and the session info is available on the OSF repository of the corresponding paper (https://osf.io/h4vp6/).
